## Assignment Reflection

Please reflect on your experience with this assignment. What was most challenging? What was most interesting?
It was very hard writing the read file stuff as I wasn't sure how I would take in my input, and processing the input itself was very long and excruciating. 
Breadth-first search was also awfully hard to implement, as I couldn't find a way (after lots of trial) to have the program switch between left and right node, while remembering the path it took to get there. So, in the end, I kept DFS. I am very interested to see how to get this to work with BFS!
